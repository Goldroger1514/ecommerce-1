Netlify is a platform that focuses on getting front end modern applications up as easy as possible
They've really taken the world by storm in the last two , three years and they're only continuing to grow

So this is a really stable great service to use for hosting our applications And we get great things like 

Continuous integration right out of the box

1- Import from Git {
  What this allows us to do is directly choose the GitHub account that we have that we want to host our application through

  The great thing about this is because whenever you make a push to GitHub , to the specific branch that you want to deploy
  it will automatically rebuild on Netlify
  Meaning that your website is always up to date to a specific branch that you have , that you want to be your live website

  The build command is the command inside of our package JSON that builds and serves the final packet of our website after it's been 
  minified and amplified and all that stuff

  Modification and uglification is the process where we convert our fancy readable code into a less readable but much more optimized code
  And it's handled all by webpack (npm run build)

  What's happening behind the scenes right now is that netlify is running our create react app build script to build out the final folder that is going to actually
  use to host our website
}
